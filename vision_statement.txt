Very Scary "escape from house" Game 

This product is for the casual gamer looking for a good scare and a challenging puzzle.
<Insert name of game here> is a horror-thriller that looks to fill the void of a
truly frightening 2D 8-bit game that requires serious thinking and resource management.
Unlike other indie 2D horror games, our product will reimagine the genre with a 
classic trope of escaping involving a decrepid house and a crazed murderer with a beautiful
and nostalgic art design.
