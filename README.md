Our product backlog (including user stories and tasks) can be found by using the link found in trello_link.txt. That link will take you to our publicaly visible Trello page. Currently we are writing out all the tasks for what needs to be done and developing the user stories. The Trello board is still a WIP and being updated daily.

And obviously if you found this you found out GitHub. We currently have a master branch and a Sprint 1 branch. Once Sprint 1 is over it will be merged into master and another branch forked off.
