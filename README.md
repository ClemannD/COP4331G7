## Vision Statement
> This product is for the casual gamer looking for a good scare and a challenging puzzle. <Insert name of game here> is an atmospheric horror thriller puzzle game that looks to fill the void of a truly frightening 2D pixel art style game that requires serious thinking and resource management.
Unlike other indie 2D horror games currently on the market, our product will reimagine the genre with a classic trope of escape horror involving a decrepid house with a crazed murderer and traps abound, all in a beautiful and nostalgic art design unlike any other.
